Hello there!!.. 
This is one of my very beginning projects.. 
Just wondered that a simple matrix can be used to make a tictactoe canvas.. 

Made to together with to [@Shivansh-SVNIT](https://github.com/Shivansh-SVNIT)

Use numpad to play.. assume the numpad order as your playing matrix
To play this :
if pressed
1: position :- 3rd row 1st column
2: position :- 3rd row 2nd column
3: position :- 3rd row 3rd column
4: position :- 2nd row 1st column
5: position :- 2nd row 2nd column
6: position :- 2nd row 3rd column
7: position :- 1st row 1st column
8: position :- 1st row 2nd column
9: position :- 1st row 3rd column


enjoy!!
