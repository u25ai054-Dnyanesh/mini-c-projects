Hello there!!.. 
This is one of my very beginning projects.. 
Just wondered that a simple matrix can be used to make a tictactoe canvas.. 

Made to together with to [@Shivansh-SVNIT](https://github.com/Shivansh-SVNIT)

Row starting with 0 and go upto 2(i.e. 3 rows)
Row starting with 0 and go upto 2(i.e. 3 columns)
To play this :
When its turn of X
enter the row and column of the place in matrix at which u want to put the X.
When its turn of 0
enter the row and column of the place in matrix at which u want to put the 0.

enjoy!!
